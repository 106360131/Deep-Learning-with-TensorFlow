Deep Learning with TensorFlow by Packt

This is the code repository for [Deep Learning with TensorFlowDeep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-tensorflow?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786469786), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Go to Mapt
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
>>> import tensorflow as tf
>>> hello = tf.constant("hello TensorFlow!")
>>> sess=tf.Session()
```

All the examples have been implemented using Python version 2.7 on a Ubuntu Linux 64
bit including the TensorFlow library version 0.11.
You will also need the following Python modules (preferably the latest version):
Pip
Bazel
Matplotlib
NumPy
Pandas
Preface
[ 3 ]
Only for Chapter 8, Advanced TensorFlow Programming and Chapter 9, Reinforcement
Learning, you will need the following frameworks:
